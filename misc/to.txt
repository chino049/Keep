----------------solidity smart contracts
Ethereum protocol uses blockchain technology for smart contacts without centralized 
oracles are devices that bring data into a blockchain
Hybrid smart contracts , smart conteact with an off chain component
chainlink allows for unlimited smart contract customization
chainlink is a decentralized oracle network module
blockchains are decentralized, node operators are individuals that make up blockchain
all these independedn individuals make the blockchain networks decentralized
blockchains are immutable
freedom and trust
blockchains are decentralized, transparent, speed/fast, immutable, remove conflicts, trusted, 
hydryd smart contracts off-chain
DAO - Decentrilized automonous organizations

go to etherscan and type your wallet to see transactions

etherscan is a block explorer to view transactions
gas is unit of cumputational measurem, which is a fee to pay to node operators for including 
a transaction into a blockchain

we actually get to pick how much gas fee to pay for our transaction
transaction fee = gas used * gas prices

ethereum uses a Keccak256 hash (sha family) 
a block is like a hash but with data fields like block, Nonce and Data
the nonce is used by miners to come up with a hash that starts with 0000
done by brute force

a blockchain uses fields like block, nonce, data, but alse the hash from the previous blockchain
 
a blockchain can be changed and re-mined again, however, the new blockchain will no match all other
nodes. This blockchain will be excluded from all other blockchains that are in sync

mining is the process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem - find a hash that starts
with 0000. Nodes gert paid for mining blocks

private key, only known to the holder, it is used to sign transactions
public key, is ued to verify singed transactions where signed with your private key.  
 
signing a transaction - A one way process. A private key signs a transaction by the private key
being hashed with their trtansaction data. With your public key anyone can verify the transaction
hash.

consensus;  proof of work and proof of stake. Mechanism used to reach an agreement on state or a signle
value on the blockchain. 
The consensus process ha a chain selection altgorithm and a sybil resisteance mechanism.
PoW - proof of work -  minning node, who the block author is, rce to come up with the solution
PoS - proof of stake -
Chain selection rule ; who the real blockchain is. Nakamoto Consensus -  pwo and longer chain rule.
confirmation refers to the blocks after yours

deterministic = concensus reached, meaning all nodes came to same result or conclusion.
ex. deterministic is uint256 value is 1 + 1
ex non deterministic is uint256 value = random() or unit256 value = api_call() ( blockchains cant all agree on API calls)


sybil attack  and 51% attack
ethereum will upgrade to eth2 to use proof of stake
proof of stake nodes put up collateral as sybil resistence to behave honestly aka stake.
in this system nodes put up collateral or stake and when misbehaved the stake looses money
in proof of stake, nodes are randomly choosen to propose the new block and the rest or validators
will verify the node has proposed the block honestly 


ethereum two will use proof of stake and sharding. Sharding is a solution to scalability. A blockchain 
of a blockchain.  
layer 1 are base layer blockchain implementaions
layer 2 is an application on top of layer 1

eth and bts are proof of work blockchain that follow Nakamoto concensus
eth2 will bve a proof of stake sharded bclockchain

erc20 are token deployed on a chain using erc20 token standrd
its s smart contract that represents a token
why token ERC20
1- governance
2- secure underlying network
3- create synthetic asset
4- anything else

build a a smart contrat that follows erc-20 standard and have specific functions


Technically, “token” is just another word for “cryptocurrency” or “cryptoasset.” 
But increasingly it has taken on a couple of more specific meanings depending on context. 
The first is to describe all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum (even though they are technically also tokens).
The second is to describe certain digital assets that run on top of another cryptocurrencies’ blockchain, 
as many decentralized finance (or DeFi) tokens do. Tokens have a huge range of potential functions,
 from helping make decentralized exchanges possible to selling rare items in video games. 
 But they can all be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency.

to sell a token go to
app.uniswap.org, create a pool

defipulse.com or defillama.com
application that show top defi projects based on total assets locked on each protocol
testnet.aave.com
paraswap.io decentrilized exchange (exchange tokens)
swap your tokens
aave is a lending and borrowing application, you can gain by staking or depositing an asset
aETH is an interest bearing token with can be converted back to ETH 
you canj use ETH to borrow, like DAI stable coin to equal 1 USD, USDT and USDC are also stablecoins 
stablcoinns are token that will be stable by mathing the value of another asset, or been less volitile

borrowing 
frictionless short selling
obtain liquidity without selling your capital
gain yield on your deposit collateral
things impossible to do in the traditional fintech, like falsh loans

with aave, if the amount you borrow is too high you can get liquidated and loose your asset, to pay someone else
the health factor, reflect how close you are to been liquidated (reached 1)

quantitive DEFI engineer

the address of an aave contract is called WETHGateway, which swapped eth for weth
weth is am erc20 version of ethereum, which allows to work with all other erc20s


Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity markets protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. 
Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an 
overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.



erc-20 are fungable token - Map 1 address and how much the address holds

ntfs are also known as erc-721 - has unique token ID which an owner, and a token uri

semi fungable token erc-1155

you can view them on platforms like Opensea
an erc-721 token can have metadata

an uri is a string containing the identity of a phusical or logical resource, 2 types of uri; url and urn 

to render an image on an nft
1 get ipfs
2 add tokenURI json file to IPFS
3 add IPFS URI tp your NFT URI

use chainlink to lern this process

nfts are hybryd smart contracts, 

A token uri is a distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.

To store data in a decentralized way, there are options
ochain
skynet
arweave
filecoin
ipfs
ethereum

3 methoda to upgeade a contract
-not really / parameterize, simplest, cant add storage nor add/update logic, who is the admin (consider governance)

-social YEET / Mitigation, create a new one and tell everyone to use the latest, this will apply the immutable
pros - true to blockchain values , easy to audit
cons - work to convince all users to move, and different address


-Proxie - truest for of upgrades, uses delegate call, one proxy contract that will have the same address forever 
and will route users to the correct implementaion contract that has the logic. Tp upgrade, deploy a new implementaion contract and point the proxy to that new implementaion
proxie contract has 
1 implementation contract - all our code, when upgradr, we launch a brand new implementation contract
2 proxy contract - points to which implementation is the correct one and routes function calls there
3 the user - they make calls to proxy
4 admin - user or group/voters to decide to upgrade to new implementation

All storage/data will be stored on the proxy contract
trillabits does not recommend proxies

issues or gotchas are 
1 storage clashes - you can only append new storage values, can change or reorder old ones
2 function selector - 

Transparent proxu pattern
admins can only call admin functions and not implementation functions, users can only call functions in the implementation,
admin functions are functions that govern upgrades and are located in the proxy contract

Universal Upgradable proxy - UUPS
puts all the upgrade logic in the implementation contract and not on the proxy

Diamon proxy
it allows multiple implementaion contracts

The risk of upgrades is centralization; if you are the only wallet that controls the proxy then your application is
centrilized. 



Wrapped Ether (WETH) is a token pegged to Ether (ETH). WETH is used in several platforms and DApps that support ERC-20 tokens. 
While ETH is used to pay for network transaction fees, it doesn't have the same functionality as ERC-20 tokens. You can easily convert ETH into WETH through a process known as wrapping.
